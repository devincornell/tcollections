# `tcollections`: Typed Collections

This package offers a set of collection and grouping types that are useful for data pipelines. The collections here offer a style that maintains the clarity and structure of traditional Python data structures while exposing a functional interface inspired by popular data science packages such as `pandas`.

See the examples in `examples/` for further explanation.
